# LTPI IP Implementation
This repository contains:
- Verilog Source Code of standalone LTPI IP (SCM + HPM)
- Intel速 Quartus速 Example Project File for Intel速 MAX速 10 CPLD
- Complete set of LTPI Unit Tests Implementation Package

LTPI IP that is compliant with the DC-SCM 2.x LTPI Specification. The DC-SCM 2.x LTPI specification is developed under Hardware Management Module Sub-project: https://www.opencompute.org/w/index.php?title=Server/MHS/DC-SCM-Specs-and-Designs

# Documentation:
The architecure details and a user guide covering how to build LTPI IP and run all unit tests under simulation is located in [docs/LTPI_User_Guide.pdf](docs/LTPI_User_Guide.pdf)

# Tests:
The list of unit tests implemented for LTPI IP is located [docs/LTPI_test_plan.xlsx](docs/LTPI_test_plan.xlsx)
