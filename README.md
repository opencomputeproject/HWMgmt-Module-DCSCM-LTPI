# LTPI IP Implementation
This repository contains:
- Verilog Source Code of standalone LTPI IP (SCM + HPM)
- Intel® Quartus® Example Project File for Intel® MAX® 10 CPLD
- Complete set of LTPI Unit Tests Implementation Package

LTPI IP that is compliant with the DC-SCM 2.x LTPI Specification. The DC-SCM 2.x LTPI specificatio is developed under Hardware Management Module Sub-project: https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Hardware_Management/Hardware_Management_Module
