LTPI Project
===========

Introduction:
-----
    LTPI is a protocol and interface designed for tunneling various low-speed signals 
    between the HPM and SCM. 
    The LTPI protocol goes over the LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signals) electrical 
    interfaces supported by majority of the CPLDs and FPGAs. 
    It allows for tunneling of not only GPIOs but also low speed serial interfaces 
    such as SMBus, I2C, UART.
